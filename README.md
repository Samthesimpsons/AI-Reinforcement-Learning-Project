50.021 Artificial Intelligence Project - Wordle Solver using Reinforcement Learning

## Details
**Project Title:** Wordle AI Solver 

**Description:**

Playing Wordle from https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html on hard mode

Proposed Models under `*/models`

1. Wordle Basic RL (15k words)
2. Wordle Hierarchical Clustering based on Levenshtein distance RL (15k words)
3. Wordle Hierarchical Clustering based on Levenshtein distance RL (2k words)
4. Search Algorithm (15k words)
5. Search Algorithm (2k words)

Evaluate between all models, under `analysis.ipynb`. 
Results saved to `*/evaluation_results` and `*/grid_search_results`

Proposed GUI:

- Daily Wordle Solver GUI using PyGame under `wordle_solver_pygame.py`
- Model Performance GUI using Kivy under `wordle_performance_kivy.py`

**Tools used:**
1. **Python**, env under `requirements.txt`.
