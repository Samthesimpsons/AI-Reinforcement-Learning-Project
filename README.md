50.021 Artificial Intelligence Project - Wordle Solver using Reinforcement Learning

## Details
**Project Title:** Wordle AI Solver 

**Description:**

Playing Wordle from https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html on hard mode

Proposed Models:

1. Wordle Basic RL (15k words)
2. Wordle Hierarchical Clustering based on Levenshtein distance RL (15k words)
3. Wordle Hierarchical Clustering based on Levenshtein distance RL (2k words)
4. Search Algorithm (15k words)
5. Search Algorithm (2k words)

Evaluate the speed and accuracy between using 15k and 2k words;
Similar evaluate the speed and accuracy between using RL and Search.

Proposed GUI:

- Daily Wordle Solver GUI using PyGame
- Model Performance GUI using Kivy

**Tools used:**
1. **Python** under requirements.txt
